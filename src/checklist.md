# Checklist

1. Set up new Gmail for WLUA (✓) and **provide login credentials**.  I will use this information to make the website live and include public calendar events.
2. Purchase domain name of your choice (✓) and **provide login credentials**.  I will use this information to deploy the site.
3. **Image quality**: Even at their original size, the images are blurry.  I can try to incorporate them in a different way but I would recommend using other images if possible.
4. **Spotlight Photos** separate from green background. 
5. First round of design feedback for the website.
