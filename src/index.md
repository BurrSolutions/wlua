# To Do

Send all text and image content to <knnthrmllr@gmail.com>.

Set up new Gmail for WLUA and provide login credentials.  I will use this information to make a public events calendar that you can edit and update at anytime.  **I will not save this information** and I encourage you to change the password at the conclusion of the project.

Purchase domain name of your choice and provide login credentials.  I will use this information to deploy the site.  **Again, I will not save this information** and I encourage you to change the password at the conclusion of the project.

Decision on site handoff/maintenance.  Your choice will affect the final build process.
