Decision on site handoff/maintenance.  Your choice will affect the final build process.

# Sample Fonts

Note: This text loads faster than the font samples below. According to a study done by Google, the typical user expects the content of a website to load within two seconds. On average, 57% of users will leave a site if content has not loaded in three seconds. The current build is requesting fonts from Google. Your selection will be hosted locally upon final build and this delay will no longer occur. Feel free to look at the [Google font library](https://fonts.google.com/?vfonly=true&preview.text=Washington+Lacrosse+Umpires+Association&preview.text_type=custom) for alternatives.
