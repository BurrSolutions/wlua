Founded in 1990

Welcome to the Washington Lacrosse Umpires Association (WLUA) website. We hope to connect with all of our members to share news and updates.

If you are interested in becoming an official for girls lacrosse from youth level through high school please send us an email! Registration begins in the early fall of each year and training begins in January of each year. Our season runs from early March through early June and we offer additional opportunities throughout the year.
